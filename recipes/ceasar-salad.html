    <h2>A classic chicken salad recipe, featuring crunchy croutons and a creamy, garlic dressing.</h2>
    <p>This recipe serves 2 generously for dinner or 4 as a side.</p>
    <p>A hearty salad like this requires restraint in the dressing department; an overdressed Ceasar can be overwhelmingly rich, so we start small with the dressing and serve the extra on the side for those who'd like more.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium ciabatta loaf</li>
      <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 large cos or romaine lettuce, leaves separated</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the dressing:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>2 anchovies from a tin</li>
      <li>medum block parmesan cheese for grating and shaving</li>
      <li>5 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oven to 180C. Tear 1 medium ciabatta into big, ragged croutons, or cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2 tbsp olive oil.</li>
      <li>Rub the oil into the bread and season with a little salt if you like. Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly</li>
      <li>Rub 2 chicken breasts with 1 tbsp olive oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan and leave for 4 mins.</li>
      <li>Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more.</li>
      <li>Bash 1 garlic clove with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher.</li>
      <li>Grate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, 5 tbsp mayonnaise and 1 tbsp white wine vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt.</li>
      <li>Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear 1 large cos or romaine lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons.</li>
      <li>Add most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the parmesan on top and serve straight away.</li>
    </ol>
